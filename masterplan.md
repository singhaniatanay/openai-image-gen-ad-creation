- **Objectives:**
    - Streamline ad creation from concept to high-resolution asset.
    - Ensure brand consistency through a centralized knowledge base.
    - Leverage competitor performance data for inspiration and benchmarking.
    - Deliver a simple, intuitive web interface that minimizes design friction.

### 2. Target Audience & Value Proposition

- **Primary Users:**
    - In-house marketing teams at mid-sized brands.
    - Agencies managing Meta/Google Ads campaigns.
    - Creative directors and startup founders seeking fast, on-brand visuals.
- **Pain Points Addressed:**
    - Inconsistent brand theme when using generic tools.
    - Lengthy iteration cycles: idea → sketch → final output.
    - Limitations of existing AI in Canva and similar platforms.
- **Unique Value:**
    - OpenAI-powered image generation tuned with brand assets.
    - On-demand competitor benchmarks to guide creative decisions.
    - Full asset management and lightweight editing without external tools.

### 3. Core Features & Roadmap

### MVP (v1, 1-Month Launch)

1. **Brand Asset Ingestion**: Upload logos, specify color palettes, fonts.
2. **Automated Website Crawl**: Pull product details & brand copy.
3. **Competitor Ad Scraping**: Fetch images & performance metrics (CTR, engagement) via Meta & Google transparency APIs.
4. **Natural-Language Prompt Interface**: Chat-style prompt on a blank canvas to generate ad previews.
5. **Asset Management**: Versioning, folders, tagging, export as PNG.

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)

- Direct Meta/Google Ads integration for campaign push.
- Role-based permissions and SSO authentication.
- In-app analytics dashboard for tool usage and creative performance.
- Scheduled competitor data refresh (daily/weekly).
- High-res vs. low-res preview toggle.
- More advanced editing: text layer exports (PSD, SVG).

### 4. High-Level Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React (or similar) web app with a minimalist, clean UI.
- **Backend & Cloud Services:** Supabase (database, storage, auth, edge functions) for a cohesive cloud-first platform.
- **Data Storage:**
    - Brand & metadata: Supabase Postgres database.
    - Asset storage: Supabase Storage for images & crawled media.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI Image Generation API for both previews & final assets.
- **Competitor Data:** Scheduled or on-demand crawlers using Meta Ad Library API & Google Ads Transparency API.
- **Deployment:** Supabase Edge Functions for serverless logic, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### 5. Conceptual Data Model Conceptual Data Model

- **Brand**: {id, name, logos[], colorPalette, fonts[], websiteUrl, metadata}
- **Product**: {id, brandId, name, description, images[]}
- **AdCreative**: {id, brandId, prompt, generatedImageUrl, layers[], timestamp, version}
- **CompetitorAd**: {id, brandDomain, imageUrl, metrics{ctr, clicks, engagement}, fetchedAt}
- **User**: {id, email, passwordHash, createdAt}

### 6. UI/UX Design Principles & Flow

- **Flow:** Landing → Sign-up/Login → Dashboard → Brand Setup → Select Brand → Ad Creation Canvas → Preview & Edit → Export.
- **Design:** Minimalist, ample whitespace, clear typography.
- **Canvas:** Split view with chat-prompt on left, dynamic canvas center.
- **Editing Tools:** Contextual toolbars for text, element adjustments, styling tweaks.
- **Feedback:** Loading indicators during AI generation, notifications when assets ready.

### 7. Security & Authentication

- **Auth:** Standard email/password signup & login with secure hashing.
- **Encryption:**
    - **In Transit:** Enforce HTTPS/TLS across all endpoints.
    - **At Rest (Credentials):** AES-256 encryption for password hashes & sensitive data.
- **Permissions:** Flat user model for v1; all users have same access level.

### 8. Development Phases & Milestones

1. **Week 1:** Project setup, user authentication, brand asset ingestion UI
    - Initialize Git repository, configure linting and formatting rules
    - Create a new Supabase project and configure auth settings
    - Implement user signup/login flows using Supabase Auth
    - Build brand asset ingestion UI: logo upload, color palette, font inputs
2. **Week 2:** Website crawler & brand knowledge store; storage integration
    - Develop crawler to fetch product details and brand copy from target URLs
    - Design and implement schema in Supabase Postgres for brand knowledge
    - Integrate Supabase Storage to hold crawled media and brand assets
    - Write edge function to trigger crawl on-demand
3. **Week 3:** Competitor data pipeline (on-demand fetch) & storage
    - Connect to Meta Ad Library and Google Ads Transparency APIs via edge functions
    - Create on-demand fetch endpoints and data ingestion scripts
    - Store competitor ad media and metrics in Supabase Storage and Postgres
    - Add simple dashboard view for verifying fetched data
4. **Week 4:** Ad creation canvas, OpenAI integration, preview workflow, basic editing & PNG export
    - Build chat-style prompt interface on the canvas screen
    - Integrate OpenAI Image Generation API for low- and high-resolution outputs
    - Implement basic editing tools (text edits, element adjustments, styling tweaks)
    - Add export functionality to download final creatives as PNG
    - Conduct initial usability test on ad creation flow
5. **Optional Buffer:** Polish UI, end-to-end testing, bug fixes, deployment
    - Conduct usability testing sessions and gather feedback
    - Address critical bugs, optimize performance, and finalize documentation
    - Deploy to production with Supabase hosting and monitor initial usage


### 9. Potential Challenges & Mitigation Potential Challenges & Mitigation Potential Challenges & Mitigation

- **AI Inconsistency:** Quality may vary—mitigate with multiple attempts, context refinement.
- **API Costs:** Monitor OpenAI usage; implement low-res previews to control credits.
- **Data Reliability:** Public API limits or changes—abstract crawler logic to swap sources easily.
- **Performance:** Lazy-load assets; cache frequent requests in Redis or CDN.

### 10. Future Expansion Possibilities

- In-house fine-tuned model for brand-specific styles.
- Multi-format exports: SVG, PSD layers.
- Role-based access & SSO for enterprise customers.
- Campaign automation: direct ad scheduling & spend optimization.
